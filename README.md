# My App

## Description
**What is my app, and why is it useful?**

HeelShop is a campus specific marketplace app.

## Functionality
**App Functionality from the user's perspective**

Only individuals with a university emailc an access the app. Users login and would be able to post either items to sell or create a personal business.

## Process
**How I made the app**

My friend made me a mockup, and using this rough outline I logged into Swift and let my creativity loose.

## Attributes
**Features within the app**

- Used "Fake Store API" to populate the listings within the home and discover page. On the discover page, I filtered the data to only include discounted items and populated the corresponding section
- Performed network calls complete with data error and a loading screen for when images were loading.
- Used LazyGrids and Scroll Views for a majority of the app so that the page only populates as far as the user scrolls.
- App conforms to MVVM design, it might be a little messy because this was the first time I tried to apply the design pattern within swift.

**Obstacles and Future Additions**

  <summary>Scroll View</summary>
  Successfully incorporated a scroll view
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Search Bar</summary>
  Work in progress, managed to create a search bar to filter in user input but I need to figure out how to make it a reusable view as well as make another view "pop up" while the user is typing in the search bar.

<details>
  <summary>Shopping Cart</summary>
  I want this cart to show all the items users have liked and palce it in their bag.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Accounts Page</summary>
  Still a work in progress, I want this page to show user information tied to their account and listings.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>User Login</summary>
  Still a work in progress, I want for the login to only accent emails ending in "unc.edu"
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Data Base</summary>
  While the app is currently tied to a mockdata API, I hope to be able to create my own data base complete with user account information, listings, and businesses.
