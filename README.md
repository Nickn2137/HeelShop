## HeelShop
HeelShop is a marketplace app designed specifically for university students to buy and sell items locally with ease. Unlike traditional platforms, HeelShop eliminates the need for shipping, long-distance travel, or dealing with strangers by restricting access to verified students within the same school. Additionally, HeelShop provides an outlet for student-made businesses to not only sell their products but also promote their brand within the campus community. Currently, the only comparable method is posting on social media platforms. However, this approach lacks organization, clutters users feeds with items that might not interest them, and discourages many individuals who feel too shy to post publicly. HeelShop addresses these challenges by creating a safer, more organized, and community-focused marketplace tailored to the unique needs of campus life.

## Functionality
To access HeelShop, users must first create an account using a university email ending in ".unc.edu," ensuring that only verified students can join the platform. Once registered, users are greeted with the Home Page, which showcases local shops and postings. From here, users can press on the large "+" button to create postings quickly and with ease. Additionally, the app includes several key features designed to enhance the user experience:
- **Discover Page:** Helps users explore and find items or businesses that match their interests.
- **Message View:** Where buyers and sellers can communicate with one another to facilitate transactions.
- **Account Page:** Allows users to manage their account information, view and edit their listings, and promote their student-made businesses.

Here's a video to showcase the app:

## Process
The development of HeelShop began by identifying a problem I was passionate about solving: improving the efficiency and safety of selling items on campus while facilitating commerce among students. I started by brainstorming and sketching a rough design on paper to visualize the app's layout and core functionalities. To refine this vision, I enlisted the help of a friend to create a Figma mockup, which provided a clearer structure for organizing the app's features and user interface.

With the concept defined, I began teaching myself the technical skills required to bring the app to life. Using knowledge gained from an iOS bootcamp, online courses, and ChatGPT, I learned and applied key iOS development concepts. Equipped with these tools, I allowed my creativity to guide me throughout development process, constantly approaching the app from a userâ€™s perspective. This ensured that every feature and design decision aligned with the goal of creating an intuitive and user-friendly marketplace experience.

## Attributes

Here are some notable features of my app. Additional features, such as the implementation of Firebase, custom databases, and more, are expected as I progress further in development.

- **MVVM Design Pattern:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, marking the first time I implemented this architecture in Swift. While the implementation might be a bit messy due to the learning process, it demonstrates a structured approach to app development.
- **Optimized Layouts with LazyGrids and Scroll Views:** Leveraged LazyGrids and Scroll Views throughout the app to ensure efficient loading and rendering of content, with pages populating dynamically as the user scrolls.
- **API Implementation:** Integrated the "Fake Store" API and utilized tools like JSONDecoder() to populate product listings. The Discover page features a custom filter that dynamically showcases only discounted items in the corresponding section.
- **Data Handling:** Implemented network calls with comprehensive error handling, including user-friendly alerts for data issues. The app also includes a loading screen to handle image rendering, ensuring a smooth user experience during content loading.
